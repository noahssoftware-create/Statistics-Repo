My goal is to help Business owners and Statistician alike, from helping understand their data and make it a seemless process after getting data.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some models and equations I am working on to help businesses and what they do:
1) Z Score Calculator (Helps find where data lies within the whole population and gives probabilities)
2) Regression Calculator and graph (Shows you the general path of data, growth/decay, profits and how much your data relates to the regression)
3) Graphing data Weather it be Scatter Plots, Time Series Graph, or Histograms easy graphing will be availible for everyone to use
4) As i better understand Statistics and Coding I will add more many things interest me like Brownian Motion and Scholes Model and soon hope to work with those ideas until then any feedback is much appriciated!
